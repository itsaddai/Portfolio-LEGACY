      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/19468020.jpg" class="tech-img">
      <p>
        I'm currently a second-year student studying computer science at Wilfrid Laurier University. <br>
        I am a relentlessly studious individual, and am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from my academic endeavours, you'll find me creating side projects, learning new programming languages, reading, and being an active member of clubs and societies at my school. <br>
        Presently, I am an outreach coordinator of Laurier's computing society, a website developer for a non-profit organization named CCubed, and a student representative for the faculty of science at Laurier.

      </p>
      <p>
        In between high school and my start at Laurier, I worked as a cast member at a movie theatre, allowing me to learn first-hand the implications of running a business, and learning how to interact with various audiences.
        <br>
        I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of working others and speaking to customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For as long as I can remember, I've been obsessed with technology and ever since, have looked forward to working with various types of technology for the rest of my life.<br>
        For this reason, I am looking for a developer position for the Summer 2022 term, and am open to any opportunities that may arise.

              MorningBot is a personal project of mine I began in order to create a Discord bot, one that <br>
              would allow me to easily display a part of my morning routine, the weather, and a motivational quote to help me get a strong start on my day.
